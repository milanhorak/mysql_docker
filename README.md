# mysql_docker
Practice working with mysql in docker.
The script reads csv files, performs data processing, sorts list of lists by multiple criteria, counts occurrences by criteria,
prepares data for writing to the database, creates a database if it does not exist, creates a table if it does not exist,
writes data to the database and performs several sql queries.
